SimplexGridFactory
==================

Contains convenience  interfaces to triangle (via  Triangulate.jl) and
TetGen via TetGen.jl.  Code using it  needs to pass the Triangulate or
the   TetGen   modules   as   parameters   to   the   constructor   of
SimplexGridBuilder  and thus  needs to  adhere to  their respective
license conditions. This package itself is MIT licensed.
